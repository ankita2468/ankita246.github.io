    <h1>Fulpati</h1>
    <p>After six days of Ghatasthapana, people celebrate Fulpati on the seventh day of the Dashain Festival. The day falls on Saptami tithi of the month Ashwin (September / October) as per the Nepali lunar calendar.

        On this day, people bring nine different varieties of flowers and plants into their home. All nine plants represent nine goddesses of health, wealth, and prosperity. So, Fulpati is the next important event in this festival.</p>

    <p>Once Fulpati arrives at Hanumandhoka Durbar, people start celebrating the festival. The performers of Gurujyu Paltan play Baja-Gaza ('Musical instrument') and perform special dance and music. They fire traditional Flintlock Muskets in the palace. People worship Navadurga with huge ebullience.

        King Prithivi Narayan Saha started the tradition of bringing Fulpati from the Historic Gorkha Palace. This event is performed so the Goddess Durga Bhawani blesses Kathmandu city equal to Gorkha.
    
        Army units from different camps organize "Phulpati Badhai'' event at Tudikhel. During this event, the Nepalese Army performs parades and also exhibits cannon firing. They perform the whole event in the presence of the president of Nepal.</p>
